## setup

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(nflreadr)
```



## Data cleaning

```{r data}
s24 <- nflreadr::load_pbp(seasons = 2024)

s24rp <- s24 %>% 
  filter(play_type %in% c("run", "pass"),
         two_point_attempt == 0) %>% 
  select(play_id, down, ydstogo, posteam, yardline_100, half_seconds_remaining, game_seconds_remaining, shotgun, no_huddle, goal_to_go, posteam_timeouts_remaining, score_differential, play_type)

write.csv(s24rp, "s24rp.csv")



s24pfg <- s24 %>% 
  filter(play_type %in% c("run", "pass", "punt", "field_goal"), 
         two_point_attempt == 0) %>% 
  select(play_id, down, ydstogo, posteam, yardline_100, half_seconds_remaining, game_seconds_remaining, shotgun, no_huddle, goal_to_go, posteam_timeouts_remaining, score_differential, play_type)


#added goal_to_go, posteam_timeouts_remaining
#got rid of two point conversion attempts, missing values for down

write.csv(s24pfg, "s24pfg.csv")

```


Classes of full dataset

```{r structure}
s24 %>% 
  group_by(play_type) %>% 
  summarise(count = n())
```

Looking at punts and field goals

```{r s24_pfg}
s24pfg %>% 
  mutate(down4 = ifelse(down == 4, 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(play_type) %>% 
  summarise(down4_pct = mean(down4)) 

#na, do we have to get rid of 2pt conversions

sum(is.na(s24pfg$down))

#147 where down is NA, all on runs and passes
```

Getting rid of NA's: do they have anything in common?

Guess: 2-point conversion attempts

```{r na_analysis}
s24na <- s24pfg %>% 
  filter(is.na(down)) 

ggplot(s24na) + geom_histogram(aes(x = yardline_100))

#everything from 1 and 2 yardline, looks to be all 2 point attempts
#who went for 2 from the 15???
#some from the 7 (makes sense - 5 yard penalty)


s24 %>% 
  filter(play_type %in% c("run", "pass")) %>% 
  mutate(down_na = ifelse(is.na(down), 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(down_na) %>% 
  summarise(twopa = mean(two_point_attempt))

#all occurences when down is NA occur on 2 point conversion attempts

```
